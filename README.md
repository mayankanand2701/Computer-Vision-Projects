# Computer-Vision-Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects I built while learning **Computer Vision**. Each project explores different techniques, algorithms, and deep learning models used in **image processing, object detection, face recognition, OCR, and more**.

I will keep updating this repository as I work on new projects. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! ðŸš€
